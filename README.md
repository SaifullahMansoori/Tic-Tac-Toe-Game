# Tic Tac Toe

This repository contains two implementations of the classic Tic Tac Toe game: one is a console-based version, and the other is a graphical user interface (GUI) version.

## Console-based Tic Tac Toe

The console-based Tic Tac Toe is a simple text-based implementation of the game. Players take turns to enter the row and column numbers to place their X or O on the 3x3 grid. The game logic is implemented using Java and provides feedback on game results through the command-line interface. The console version is lightweight and easy to understand.

To play the console-based Tic Tac Toe, simply run the `TicTacToeConsole.java` file and follow the on-screen instructions.

## GUI Tic Tac Toe

The GUI Tic Tac Toe is a more interactive and visually appealing version of the game, implemented using Java Swing. The players can click on the cells of the 3x3 grid to place their X or O. The GUI version provides visual feedback on game results, highlighting the winning cells and displaying graphical messages for wins and draws. The game also includes a "Reset" button to start a new game.

To play the GUI Tic Tac Toe, run the `TicTacToeUI.java` file, and a window will appear where you can interact with the game using the mouse.
